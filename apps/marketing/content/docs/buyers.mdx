# How to Buy on Chainfiles

Buying a file on **Chainfiles** is fast and secure.
There are no accounts, no checkout forms, and no middlemen — just a one-click purchase using your crypto wallet.

You pay in **USDC**, a digital dollar always equal in value to USD.
Your file unlocks instantly once the payment is complete.

## 1. Set Up a Wallet (or Use Yours)

You’ll need a crypto wallet to make a purchase.
**Coinbase Wallet** is the easiest option for most people, but **any Base-compatible wallet** works — including MetaMask, Rainbow, and others.

When you install Coinbase Wallet:
1. Open the app and follow the prompts to create or import a wallet.
2. Make sure the **Base** network is selected.
3. You’re ready to make your first purchase on Chainfiles.

> 💡 Already have a wallet? Just make sure it supports the **Base** network and has some **USDC** for your purchase.

## 2. Add USDC to Your Wallet

USDC is the digital version of the US dollar (1 USDC = 1 USD).
You’ll use it to buy files on Chainfiles.

Options:
- **From Coinbase Exchange:** Buy USDC and send it to your wallet.
- **From a friend or another wallet:** Receive USDC directly to your address.
- **Bridge to Base:** If you already have USDC on another network, you can bridge it to Base using [Base Bridge](https://bridge.base.org/).

> 💡 Once you have USDC in your wallet, you can use it for any Chainfiles purchase — no sign-ups or payment cards needed.

## 3. Buy a File

1. **Open a seller’s Chainfiles page.**
   You’ll see a simple checkout screen showing the product title, description, price, and the seller’s wallet address for transparency.

2. **Click “Purchase & Download.”**
   A secure payment window will appear.

3. **Connect your wallet.**
   If you’re not already connected, choose your wallet (Coinbase Wallet, MetaMask, or any Base-compatible wallet) and approve the connection.

   Your wallet will show a **signature request** — this simply authorizes the transfer of USDC for the purchase.
   Confirm the request.

   Once complete, you’ll automatically see a **Payment Successful** page.
