# How to Sell with Chainfiles

Welcome to **Chainfiles** — the simplest way to sell digital files and get paid instantly.
No storefronts, no waiting for payouts, no setup headaches. Just upload your file, share your link, and get paid in **USDC (digital dollars)** directly to your wallet.

---

## 1. Set Up Your Coinbase Wallet

To receive payments, you’ll need a wallet. The **Coinbase Wallet app** is the easiest option - it takes minutes to set up.

- [Follow the instructions here](https://www.coinbase.com/wallet/articles/getting-started-mobile) to create a new wallet - it only takes a few minutes

When you install the app:
1. Open the app and follow the setup prompts.
2. Create or import a wallet.
3. You’re ready to receive payments when someone buys your file.

> Tip: You don’t need a full exchange account—just the wallet app is enough.

## 2. Copy Your Wallet Address

Your wallet address is where payments are sent.

1. In the Coinbase Wallet app, tap **Receive**.
2. Tap **Base** (or ETH, both share the same address).
3. Tap **Copy** next to your wallet address — it starts with `0x...`.

Keep this handy — you’ll paste it into Chainfiles when you upload your product.

## 3. Upload Your File

1. Go to the [Upload Page](/digital/upload).
2. Add a **title** and short **description** of your product.
3. Set your **price in USD** (buyers will pay in USDC).
4. **Paste your wallet address** from Step 2.
5. Upload your file (currently supports **PDF, image, or text**, up to 10 MB).
6. Accept the terms and click **Submit**.

Your product page will be created instantly.

## 4. Share Your Link Anywhere

After uploading, you’ll get a unique product link.

Share it on:
- TikTok bio or video captions
- Instagram stories or Linktree
- X (Twitter) posts
- Newsletters or personal websites

Anyone with a wallet can buy directly from your link.

## 5. Get Paid Instantly

When a buyer completes payment:
- They pay in **USDC** — a “digital dollar” always equal to USD.
- The payment goes directly to your wallet — no waiting or payout delays.
- The file automatically unlocks for download after payment.

No waiting for payouts. No middlemen. No chargebacks.
