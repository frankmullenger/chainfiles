## ðŸŽ¯ The Problem

Over **1 billion creators** face barriers to selling digital products:

- Platforms like TikTok Shop donâ€™t allow digital files (a gap for templates, guides, presets, etc.)

- Payment processors charge 3 %+ fees and delay payouts 3â€“7 days
- Complex checkout flows cause creators to lose impulse-driven buyers

**Result:** A massive untapped market for simple, direct digital sales.
